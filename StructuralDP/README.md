## Objectives :
__1. Study the Structural Design Patterns__

__2. Implement several of them in a project__

## Theory :
In Software Engineering, Structural Design Patterns are those that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Filter
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Fly-weight
   * Proxy
   
## Implementation :
In this project I've implemented 5 creational design patterns i.e. (Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Factory Method and Abstract Factory) with the emphasis on the fundamental object _**Player**_. The player class contains 4 attributes and the *get* and *set* methods as you can see in *Player.java* file. Also in that file is a method called *clone()* which is used to return a clone of the object if it exists in the *HashMap* which I'm maintaining in _**AbstractFactory**_ class.
