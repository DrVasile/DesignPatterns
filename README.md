## Objectives :
__1. Study the Creational Design Patterns__

__2. Implement them in real projects__

## Theory :
In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Singleton
   * Builder
   * Prototype
   * Object Pooling
   * Factory Method
   * Abstract Factory
   
## Implementation :
In this project I've implemented 5 creational design patterns i.e. (Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Factory Method and Abstract Factory) with the emphasis on the fundamental object _**Player**_. The player class contains 4 attributes and the *get* and *set* methods as you can see in *Player.java* file.
